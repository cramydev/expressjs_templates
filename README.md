### CHECK OTHER BRANCHES TO SEE ANOTHER TEMPLATES

---

This repo is used to store some project structure by using expressjs framework. Of course in some cases it might be helpful to use Nest.js which comes with a default structure, but I decided to create this one for those who don't use Nest.js.

The templates will be modified in case it needs to fix some issue or do some improvements.

Each template has its own README file with its description.
